// You can use print but do not forget that's a matter of preference. Otherwise, use echo

// echo "Hello " . " " . " World" . "<br>";  

// //To concatenate, the syntax goes like "First syllable or word " . " " . " another word" 

// echo "This is " . " my " . " first concatenation" . "<br>";

// //You can do concatenation like this by declaring a variable. Welcome to variable declaration! 

// $var = " World!";

// echo "Hello " . " " . $var . "<br>";

// $var = "Hello ";

// echo $var . " " . " World!" . "<br>";

// //You can also approach variable declaration like this
// $var = "Hello ";
